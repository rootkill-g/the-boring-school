# Progate August Webathon : Web Page for an Educational Institution

## URL: https://h4rsh-k.github.io/the-boring-school/

Since the pandemic, the teachers are feeling helpless as they are not able to keep their students updated.
Being unfamiliar with technology, they have never taught their students this way. 
So to ease their difficulties, the-boring-school website is to be made as user-friendly as possible, so that 
the teachers can easily navigate to the website and put up a quiz and the students can be notified about it through the notification tab, upload content for their students, etc.
